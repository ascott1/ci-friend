> A helper bot for understanding Travis CI build failures. Built with [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot) :robot:

## Features

ci-friend extracts failing test results from a [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) job log and posts them as a comment to the appropriate pull request.

## Current limitations

- Currently only works with `npm test`
- Currently only tested with Jest
- Assumes a single Travis CI job

## Setup

First clone the repostiory, insall the dependencies, and copy the `.env` file:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:ascott1/ci-friend.git
cd ci-friend
npm install
cp .env.example .env
```
Next, follow the steps found at [Configuring a GitHub App](https://probot.github.io/docs/development/#configuring-a-github-app)

Additionally, login to Travis and add your [Travis Token](https://developer.travis-ci.com/authentication) to `.env`

Now you're ready to run your app!

```
npm run dev
```
